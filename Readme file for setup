Project Overview
This project is a multi-phase system designed to demonstrate backend, service, and frontend development using modern technologies. The repository is monolithic and contains three phases: Laravel Backend, Node.js Service, and React Frontend.

Phase 1 – Laravel Backend
Phase 1 implements the backend using Laravel. It exposes REST APIs for articles, handles database migrations, and manages persistence.
How to Run Phase 1 (Local)
cd laravel-backend-clean
php artisan serve

Server runs at: http://127.0.0.1:8000
API endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/articles
Phase 2 – Node.js Service
Phase 2 is a Node.js background service that consumes backend APIs and simulates AI-based content processing. This phase does not include a UI and is validated via logs.
How to Run Phase 2 (Local)
cd node-service
node index.js

Expected output includes logs for fetching and processing articles.
Phase 3 – React Frontend
Phase 3 implements a React-based frontend that fetches articles from the backend and displays them in a browser UI.
How to Run Phase 3 (Local)
cd react-frontend
npm install
npm start

Frontend runs at: http://localhost:3000
Architecture Overview
React Frontend → Laravel Backend → Database
Node.js Service → Laravel Backend → Logs
Known Limitations
• Backend runs locally
• Phase 2 validated via logs
• Deployment is optional as per assignment guidelines
Future Improvements
• Deploy backend publicly
• Add authentication
• Enhance AI logic
• Improve frontend UI/UX
 I am Also adding the ss of each phase in the folder
